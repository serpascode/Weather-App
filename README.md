The Weather App is the most basic of React Apps.

I boostrapped it using 'npm create react-app weather-app'
Afterwhich I deleted all the extra bits that I wouldn't be making use of for this particular project.

The purpose of this Weather App is to learn how to create React Components and to incorpoate an available API.
In this case I will be consuming the https://openweathermap.org/ API, and in particular I will be using the following URL
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name},{state}&appid={your api key}

I will be making the changes through the Atom IDE and uploading them via a series of commits to this Repository.
In so doing I hope to achieve a better understanding of Git, React, and the use of API's
The git commands I will use are the following:

git commit -m "Message Associated with this particular commit"
git add -A //This command will include all changes to the repository prior to the commit

git status //Is used in order to display the list of changes that have occured in the repository 

git remote add origin [URL OF THIS REPOSITORY] // will direct the final destination of the commited files
git push -u origin master //Will push all changes directly into the master branch.

For now these are some of basic Git commands that I will be using while working with Git
I am formally documenting them here so as to maintain a record of my progress
